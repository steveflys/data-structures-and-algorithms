# K-ary tree
create a class for a K-ary tree and the node it will use

* version 0.0.1

# Challenge

- Create a Class or a `Node` which is aware of the value as `val` and children as a list collection of Nodes
        - Ensure that you have a `__repr__` and `__str__` method defined to return appropriate representations of the node
    - Create a Class for a `KTree`, which is aware of the root of the tree as `root`
        - Ensure that you have a `__repr__` and `__str__` method defined to return appropriate representations of the tree
        - This class should be aware of depth-first traversal methods for `pre_order`, and `post_order` traversals
        - This class should be aware of a breadth-first traversal method
        - This class should have the ability to `insert` a new node into the tree at a given parent node
