Do all your work in a public repository called data-structures-and-algorithms, with a well-formated, detailed top level README.md matching the example provided by your instructor
Create a branch in your repository called mergesort
On your branch, createâ€¦
C#: Inside of your Program.cs file, create a method named MergeSort() outside of Main(). Be sure the call your method within Main() when complete.
JavaScript: a file called mergesort.js
Python: a file called mergesort.py
Include any language-specific configuration files required for this challenge to become an individual component, module, library, etc.
NOTE: You can find an example of this configuration for your course in your class lecture repository.
Feature Tasks
Write a function that accepts an array of unsorted integers, and returns a sorted array by a recursive mergesort algorithm.
Structure and Testing
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
